## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Premium Editorial / High-Impact Tech** aesthetic. It uses a "Swiss Style" foundation with massive headings, sharp blacks, and vibrant Teal-600 accents to create a sense of professional authority.

## Design Patterns
-   **Massive Typography**: Use of tracking-tighter and leading-none on hero headings to dominate specific screen sections.
-   **Editorial Grayscale**: Images remain grayscale by default, revealing their full spectrum only on interactive focus (hover).
-   **Sharp Geometry**: 45-degree rotated squares for branding mixed with organic 3rem radii for article cards.
-   **Progress Feedback**: Persistent top-mounted progress bar to guide reader journey.

## Color Palette
-   **Editorial Canvas**: Slate-50 (#f8fafc)
-   **Primary Technical**: Teal-600 (#0d9488)
-   **High Contrast**: Black (#000000)
-   **Muted Data**: Slate-400/500 (#94a3b8)

## Interaction Design
-   **Transition Orchestration**: Cascading entrance animations for article lists.
-   **Spring Dynamics**: High-fidelity scroll progress bar using spring physics for smooth feedback.
-   **Micro-scale**: Elements subtly scale (95%) and shift (hover:gap-4) during interaction to provide tactile depth.
